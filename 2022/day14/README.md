# Day 14: [Regolith Reservoir](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/14)

## Part 1

This problem was similar to [2018 day 17](../../2018/day17/README.md) but with a bit different rules.

Once the cave was created, it wasn't very complicated.

## Part 2

For part 2, I went with the option of rebuilding the cave based on a set of coordinates that include not an infinite, but a big enough floor.

Then the sand filling just has to stop when we reach the entry.

Both parts run in 5 ms, which seems to be quite good.

It would be a good one to add visualization.
