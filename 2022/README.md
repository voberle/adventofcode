# Advent of Code 2022

## Wrapup

- Days 1 to 10 were all not very hard, as expected. Some required quite some work for parsing the input however.
- Day 11 was the first one that caused me real problems, due to my incomplete understanding of modular arithmetic.
- Day 12 allowed me to improve my Dijkstra implementation.
- Day 13 ended up with a very satisfying result I found, with very clean code.
