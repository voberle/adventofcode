# Advent of Code 2022

## Wrapup

- Days 1 to 10 were all not very hard, as expected. Some required quite some work for parsing the input however.
- Day 11 was the first one that caused me real problems, due to my incomplete understanding of modular arithmetic.
- Day 12 allowed me to improve my Dijkstra implementation.
- Day 13 ended up with a very satisfying result I found, with very clean code.
- Day 14, filling the cave with sand, was fun.
- Day 15 was an optimization problem, with a very big 2D space, normally I found those tricky in the past but this time I managed nicely.
- Day 16 I got stuck, left it for the end.
- Day 17 was Tetris, that was really fun (I did it in a bit complicated way tough).
- Day 18 with the cubes is one of those I'm also proud of: Not easy, but coded a complex solution that worked on first try.
- Day 19 I got stuck, left it for the end.
- Day 20 is one that wasn't that hard in theory, but I made complicated with incorrect assumptions.
- Day 21 with solving the equations required some code, but was straightforward at the end.
- Day 22 was interesting in term of design for part 1, and manual (annoying..) in part 2.
- To finish, there was an easier day 23, a very satisfying path-finding day 24 (happy with the data struct I use) and a simple day 25.
