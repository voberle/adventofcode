# Day 23: [Experimental Emergency Teleportation](https://adventofcode.com/2018/day/23)

## Part 1

First part was very simple, nothing to comment there.

## Part 2

I had to check for a hint for this one.

Like many people, I was completely stuck on this one, as I didn't realize that the easiest approach was to divide the whole space into a few smaller spaces, look for the answer in each space (at a higher resolution), pick the space with the best answer and start over.

Concretly, this meant putting all the bots into a big cube and dividing that cube into 8 smaller cubes.
