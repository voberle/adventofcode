# Day 4: [Repose Record](https://adventofcode.com/2018/day/4)

## Part 1

With a few assumptions on the input (like guards always wake up before next shift), I got it done by keeping a count of each minute asleep for each guard.

First use of `chrono` crate and DateTime.

## Part 2

The funny things is that I had initially solved part 2 by accident with part 1, I had misread the instructions :-)
