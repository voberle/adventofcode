# Day 13: [Mine Cart Madness](https://adventofcode.com/2018/day/13)

## Part 1

Nothing specially complicated here. My Grid code fitted well this exercise and the main work was carefully implementing the next_position function. And not falling into the trap that in the real input, two collisions happen at the same time.

## Part 2

Part 2 was complicated because I didn't implement correctly that the moving order of carts was important. Somehow I got (un)lucky with part 1, where I got the right answer despite that bug.
