# Advent of Code 2018

## Wrapup

This was my 5th AoC, after 2023 and 2015 to 2017.

I've read this was one of the most difficult year. It didn't feel so until the really end.

Some of the more interesting days, or that I'm proud of:

- Day 9 was an interesting optimization problem to get it fast enough.
- Day 13 I had a bug that blocked me for a bit.
- Day 15 was considered by many as very hard, but while it was a lot of work, I got it working fairly easily by comparaison.
- Day 17 with the water following felt hard initially, but it worked out well.
- Day 19 with assembly reverse engineering, something I struggled in previous AoC a lot, but I managed nicely there.
- Day 21 also with assembly reverse engineering, took me some time but I managed.
- Day 22 shortest path with growing map. I know my Dijkstra now!
- Day 24 I had a nasty bug that I must confess fixed by trying many things and got lucky.

The ones where I struggled really (they all came at the end):

- Day 20 with the parsing of the regex. I had to look for a hint on how to parse the regex in order to get it working correctly.
- Day 23 I just had no idea how to do it and had to look for a hint. As often, once you understand the idea, it seems not so hard anymore.

Also this time I have a few cool visualizations for some:

- Day 15 with the goblins and elves.
- Day 17 with the water falling.
- Day 18 with the patterns repeating.
