# Day 17: [Trick Shot](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/17)

## Part 1

My initial version explored all the options and found the highest y, but the ending condition was missing.

With some experimentation, I found the ending conditions needed.

## Part 2

Part 2 could required only a minor change to part 1.

It's brute-forced, but the whole thing runs in 3 ms, so not too bad.
