# Advent of Code 2021

## Wrapup

- Day 1 to 6 were nice, with experience they were simple enough but still interesting. I enjoyed making the code as short and nice as possible. I'm very happy with the result for days 5 and 6 in particular.
- OEIS was handy in day 7.
- Day 8 was the first complex one. It was a fun deduction game.
- Day 9 and 11 had similarities as grids where elements change based on their neighbors.
- Day 12 was finding all paths problem. I enjoyed applying correctly DFS there, and then optimizing it.
- Day 13 was one of those where a pucture forms a code of ASCII letter. I used an external crate for doing OCR on those letters.
