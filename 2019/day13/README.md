# Day 13: [Care Package](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/13)

## Part 1

The description of this day looks so excting, a game!

## Part 2

Part 2 was fun but not that easy. I ended up implementing the working game, but then I still had to *win* at the game. I implemented a save/reload mechanism, that allowed to save progress, and so managed to beat it.

## Playing the game

Run it with:

    cargo r --release -- play

To use the saved game data:

    cargo r --release -- saved
