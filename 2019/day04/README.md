# Day 4: [Secure Container](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/4)

## Part 1

Fairly simple with iterator `windows` and reusing the `get_digits` from [2018 Day 14](../../2018/day14/README.md).

## Part 2

Ended up counting the number of consecutive digits in the number. Is it the best way? Nice thing is I got the method right on first try, zero bug!
