# Day 10: [Monitoring Station](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/10)

## Part 1

That ones was a bit harder, but my final solution is fairly simple I feel.

## Part 2

Very happy with this one: I expected it to be rather tricky, and I got it almost on first try, with only a minor bug in `which_square` (needed smaller or equal).
