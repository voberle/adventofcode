# 2024 challenge

## Part 1

There were several smaller challenges:

- Implementing the shifting for both lower and upper case.
- Deciding if we should left or right shift.
- And the main one, realizing that we should only take the first 16 digits of PI and cycle through them.

## Part 2

I had to make a few tries in order to know:

- What is the biggest number to look for (10).
- Which characters to ignore, only spaces or every non-letter (the latter).
