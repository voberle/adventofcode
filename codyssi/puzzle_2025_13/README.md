# Puzzle 13: [Laestrygonian Guards!](https://www.codyssi.com/view_problem_17?)

Part 2 was simple, this my part 1 was just a special case of part 2.

Part 3 required a different implementation. I used a recursive approach to explore all possible paths, stopping when either we get a cycle or visit a location twice.

My solution seems complicated in regards to the difficulty rating of the exercise.
