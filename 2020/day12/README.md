# Day 12: [Rain Risk](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/12)

## Part 1

A simple implementation of moving following instructions.

## Part 2

This was just modifying the move instructions, and there only the waypoint turning was a bit tricky, but drawing it made it clear.

## Update

I did some refactoring to introduce a trait representing the position, allowing the code between part 1 and 2 to be better re-used.
