# Day 16: [Ticket Translation](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/16)

## Part 1

Most work went into parsing the input.

## Part 2

In part 2, once we discarded the invalid tickets, we find for each position the list of rules that work, and then we reduce those rules into one.

The method to reduce a list of options is the same as [2018 day 16](../../2018/day16/README.md).
