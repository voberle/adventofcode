# Advent of Code 2020

## Wrapup

This was my 6th AoC, after 2023 and 2015 to 2019.

This year, I managed to do ALL days with zero hint. I did use a couple of algorithms found online still (days 13 and 18).

- Days 1 to 9 were simple enough, often brute-force just working.
- Day 7 was easy as I reused a candidate pruning method from previous years, which was also used again in day 16 and 21.
- Day 10 required finding patterns in the input, something I usually don't like but I enjoyed this one.
- Day 13 was the first really tricky day. I used an LCM with offset algorithm I found online, which worked, but there were other simpler solutions.
- Day 14 took a while, because I got confused and thought brute-forcing wouldn't work, while it did and was the easiest.
- Day 15 was a style of game where part 2 numbers explode, there has been similar things in the past. Day 23 is on same theme.
- Day 18 I used the pseudo-code of the Shunting yard algorithm.
- Day 19 was somehow one of the hardest, which I had to skip and do finish completely at the end.
- The jigsaw puzzle of day 20 was a lot of work.
- For day 23 I had to brainstorm quite a bit to find the right data structure.
