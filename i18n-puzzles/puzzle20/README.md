# Puzzle 20: [The future of Unicode](https://i18n-puzzles.com/puzzle/20/)

This one left me completely stuck and I had to use the hints from the [Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/i18n_puzzles/comments/1jka4c4/comment/mjvioiw/). Honestly I'm not sure how one is supposed to figure this one out without the hints, since there are multiple steps and some magic value.

Code should be self-explanatory.
