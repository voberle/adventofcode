# Day 10: [Hoof It](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/10)

## Part 1

Once I understood the description, it wasn't very complicated with a recursive exploration.

## Part 2

Part 2 could be nicely done by reusing part 1 and recording the trails found.

Whole thing runs in 3.6 ms.

## Update

After I checked the Reddit, I realized that like many, I had solved inially part 2 when doing part 1. But I didn't notice this when doing part 2, and implemented a more complex than necessary part 2 code. We don't need to record the trails, just count how many we find. So I simplified it.
