# Day 8: [Resonant Collinearity](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/8)

## Part 1

The most work here was given two positions, calculating the positions of the antinodes. I took a simple approach, calculating separatly the columns and rows.

## Part 2

Part 2 was making a version of part 1 with a while instead of an if, in a very simplified description.

Later I updated the code to be shared between parts 1 and 2. I also figured out that the antinode calculation could be simplified further, as I didn't need to have these two cases distinguished.
