## Part 1

My solution turned out to be surprisingly simple and short, and probably fast. It looks very nice. Saving the rules as vector of 100 elements is very practical.

## Part 2

Part 2 looked rather tricky first. A trap was to make assumptions based on the test input, where one could probably have ordered all numbers only based on the rules, but this wasn't the case for the real input.

Finally, I figured it out by imagining how I would do it by hand, checked it worked manually on the 3rd test case, and then implemented it. It turns out that the implementation was very easy and worked on the first try.
