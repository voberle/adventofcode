# Day 9: [All in a Single Night](https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/9)

## Part 1

Not that easy to figure out the right graph traversal way. Ended up using the DFS method similar to 2023 day 23, with a recursive brute force approach.

Modelisation of the graph is also a bit simple, as routes are not directed, I ended adding two entries to the graph, one for each direction.

## Part 2

Finding the longest instead of the shortest was easy.
