# Day 11: [Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators](https://adventofcode.com/2016/day/11)

## Part 1

Suddenly the level of difficulty jumped a lot.

First modeling the building and the elevator took some time to get right.

Then the recursive approach was tricky to get working. The first attempt that worked I had to use an arbitrary limit in how far the recursion would go, and that allowed it to find the right answer.

## Part 2

The part 1 code hasn't worked for the bigger input of part 2. I've tried various optimizations, but no luck so far.
