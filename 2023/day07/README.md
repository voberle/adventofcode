# Day 7: [Camel Cards](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/7)

A cool exercise solved with structures for the cards and hands and custom ordering trait implementations.

## Update

I updated the code to match the format of the other years.

I also merged both parts into the same project. There is still a lot of duplicated code however.
