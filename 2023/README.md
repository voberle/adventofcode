# Advent of Code 2023

## 2023

My Rust implementations of [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023).

I was learning Rust in the process, so my goal for the exercises was not always to do it the most concise or fastest, but also to try out things.

Overall I managed to get 41 stars in the 25 days. Until the last week I was doing great, but then it got harder and I had less time due to Christmas preparations, so I couldn't finish them all by 25th. But still planning to work on them.

Each exercise has its own README linked below, indicating here only a few keywords about the exercise.

### TODO

Missing days:

- Day 17: Pathfinding with custom coordinates.
- Day 20 part 2: Special pattern in data.
- Day 21 part 2: Again special pattern in data.
- Day 24 part 2: No idea how to do part 2.
- Day 25 part 2: Press button.

Also:

- Remove table lib, replace it with pieces of customizable code.
- Extract reusable code into "utils".
