# Advent of Code 2023

## 2023

My Rust implementations of [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023).

I was learning Rust in the process, so my goal for the exercises was not always to do it the most concise or fastest, but also to try out things.

Overall I managed to get 41 stars in the 25 days. Until the last week I was doing great, but then it got harder and I had less time due to Christmas preparations, so I couldn't finish them all by 25th.

In the following weeks I finished the remaining ones. I had to use the Reddit AoC for some hints in some cases, like when there was special patterns in the data, and for the crazy part 2 of day 24.

Each exercise has its own README linked below, indicating here only a few keywords about the exercise.
