# Advent of Code 2017

## Wrapup

Another fun set of Advent of Code puzzles. It's the 4th one I did, after 2023, 2015 and 2016. It didn't feel as hard anymore, as I get more experience with the puzzles and with Rust.

Tricky days were day 3 (the spiral and its math), day 7 was lots of code (towers on platforms), day 11 with the hexa grid, day 21 as I misunderstood the meaning of rotate a square and day 23 where I converted the assembly to C.

In some puzzles, I used nice solutions or tricks. I'm very happy I also got to try Rust threads and channels in day 18.

There were multiple puzzles with CPU instructions to execute, which is always fun. Maybe I will do a general implementation that can execute most of the puzzles, that could be fun.

AoC creator has a nice post where he talks about the [what goes into the design of this year's puzzles](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/7idn6k/comment/dqy08tk/).
