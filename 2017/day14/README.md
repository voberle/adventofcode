# Day 14: [Disk Defragmentation](https://adventofcode.com/2017/day/14)

## Part 1

Surprisingly, main difficulty here was to understand that the `knot_hash` funciton of [Day 10](../day10/README.md) was best left untouched.

From there on, I just needed a way to convert the hexadecimal into bits. My solution is a bit ugly a priori, but I'm not sure what would be a nicer way.

## Part 2

For part 2, the experience of implementing the grid exploration for shortest-path algorightms was useful, and I happily got it working quite quickly.
